# Django-App-Game-Completionist
Game Completionist allows you to keep track of your gaming backlog through an activity log and achievement list. 

☐ Full-stack Django application.

☐ Connected to and performs data operations on a PostgreSQL database.

☐ Two data entities (Models) in addition to the built-in User model (one one-to-many (1:M) and one many-to-many (M:M) relationship between entities/models).

☐ Full-CRUD data operations across any combination of the app's models (excluding the User model).

☐ Authenticates users using Django's built-in authentication.

☐ Implements authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of data resources using the login_required decorator in the case of view functions; or, in the case of class-based views, inheriting from the LoginRequiredMixin class.

☐ Deployed online using Heroku.
